<p>The Image of Productivity<p> 
<br>
The image of productivity is a picture of the practice at work. Be it the documentation of a Work In Progress or of the workers themselves at work, the image is evidence of the practice’s productivity, or apparent vital momentum; that the practice is engaged and ambitious; at work but not too stressed; having fun but still producing. This type of image (and tendency to document and publish process) has ballooned in ubiquity amidst the heavy air of a digital environment which relentlessly prods its consumer-producers to enthusiastically embrace the role of the Brand Strategist, tasking behind the scenes of their own invented brand site, (part journal, part visual newsletter) whose melange of pictures broadcasts a refinement of taste, consistency of achievement, and a remote, mediated familiarity. Within the spaces of these networks of the Self-Comparing and the Constantly Plugged In, the image of productivity arouses some or momentary admiration or jealousy amongst those in and around the strategist’s world. 
<br>
We know the image of the producer putting forth work out into the world to be an exciting, vital thing. It speaks to lifeforce, creativity, and the will to make. As consumers of such images, the photos find us passive; seeing, but not ourselves producing. To behold the image of productivity is to be reminded of one’s own position as a viewer, and any admiration or jealousy which is aroused stems from this tension of imbalance; that a peer is active, while we, in contrast, are simply passive witnesses. This imbalance of metabolism may materialize in tandem with a social gulf characterized too by asymmetry. If one beholds an image of a practice at work, of its workers engaged in labor together, one is witness to a conspiracy to create. That a body of people conspired together to momentarily stop consuming images or working for others, and instead band together with the objective of putting their own collective’s work out into the world. As witnesses to such images of productivity, we (everyone else) fall under the category of ‘those excluded from the conspiracy’. We, the solitary and passive, reflect not only on our present lack of vital productivity, but our lack of a collaborative social sphere— Depressed, rut-mired, and lonesome, we, momentarily passive, pathetic viewers might be afflicted with a ‘workshop-envy’; the distress of having established neither a cooperative enterprise nor milieu, while others have. 
<br>
That said, rather than the emotions it elicits in others, the image of productivity should ultimately be measured by the intent behind its publishing.   
<br>
To publish an image of productivity is to attempt to prove one’s own will to stave off passivity, irrelevance, and reject anti-social, solitary behavior. It is to declare however haughtily or humbly: I am working (and possibly, in league with others.) The image is thus performative; the practice is at the moment of documentation ‘performing productivity’, and in so doing, actively crystallizing the mythology of itself. The understanding of a practice’s mythology requires a conception of the enterprise’s origins and the continual re-understanding or remembering of those original impulses through performance. The practice mythologizes itself by documenting how it came to be (via, for example, photographs of initial meetings) and how it presently operates (via the published products or process pics of the ‘conspiracy which creates’.) Process, then, as a performance of productivity, invokes creative fecundity, and more abstractly, a kind of lifeforce or livingness. The life of the practice’s current project, which has an origin and an establishment, is connected to the life of the practice, which involves the continual re-establishment of itself via a continuum of projects, to stave off those previously mentioned entropic ruinations; passivity, irrelevance, and loneliness. The image of productivity, then, confirms the vitality of the practice, and thus in this context the living practice can be understood to be two things: The enterprise itself and a public representation of the enterprise. 
<br>
Given this dynamic of the thing and its image, it follows then that a hypothetical practice could exist as an ‘alleged’ or ‘simulationary’ producer, creating images of a fake productivity (e.g., a sculptor forging photographic documentation to imply a new statue always in the works, an architect implying photorealistic renders are real or representing a project that is genuinely intended to be built.) This would by some measure no longer be documenting an ‘in-the-world’ productivity, but would instead be producing documentation of a simulated, meta-practice, whose products are implied-to-be-real-work or, even more theatrical, a fictional workshop camaraderie, either as a performance art for its own sake, or to convince someone of something which may somehow prove beneficial to the practice were the viewer to genuinely believe it. Similar to a currency or symbology, belief in the enterprise maintains its ‘livingness’, and thus its credibility is paramount to its own essence and self-reproduction. The practice may in fact be wholly ‘unproductive’ in terms of actual real things put into the world, but, given a convincing and active enough image of productivity it may still be considered substantially alive by others, and so, while productive in only a virtual or symbolic sense, it cannot be argued that the practice does not technically exist. 
<br>
As with most born and invented things, there is an urge to keep a practice alive, (as a vehicle with which to put out work, engage in discourse, achieve social clout, generate revenue, etc.) In opposition to this urge, there exists a tantalizing, deviant category of practice involving endeavors with a “kill-switch” built into their programming. Be it after a specified amount of time, or after a number of criteria are met, the practice ends itself, and its workers do something else. Such a practice ensures its mortal finitude via a rubric of practical and personal requirements which are intended to halt the process of the practice’s self-reproduction. Cessation of activity averts a tyranny of the image of productivity; the virtualization of the practice and its transformation from a productive enterprise into solely the idea of a productive enterprise. By placing limits on the lifespan of the practice, the focus is shifted from the logistics of continually re-animating its body, staving off decrepitude and assuaging the fears of entropy and irrelevance, back to its production of ideas, positions, and work. The liberation from images does not extricate the practice from the absurdity and meaninglessness of life, but in rejecting the un-life of images and illusions, in accepting the finite and parameterized, the now-still body retains the true blush of an original, desired vitality. 
<br>
Such a designed finitude can be understood as a literal method of practice, or, as a metaphor for an attitude which values the work over perpetual performance. Both the category of the finite practice and the attitude of opposition to the virtualization of the practice may serve to tether practitioners, amidst self-doubt and the deluge of unreal images of life, to a more authentic reality of productivity.</p>
