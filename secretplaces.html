<p>Secret Places
<p>Gold coins, silver figurines, mother of pearl buttons, bas relief pendants, and lustrous red pebbles picked up from further down the beach, grasped tightly in a sandy palm or echoing at the bottom of a plastic pail, unquestionably must be hidden in a secret corner out of sightâ€”</p>
<p>and the savvy explorer knows naturally that hollows in trees and crevices in tidal zones are good places to hide treasures.</p>
<p>Now, a lot must happen in little time. Once the joy of discovery subsides, the veteran operative will know the clock is ticking and there are immediate considerations to assess: 1. Have I been followed? 2. How discernible is the tide pool or tree hollow from the rest of the shore or the forest path? 3. How disreputable are the local birds? These questions considered and the hollow deemed adequately hidden and safe from both sandalled and winged thieves, the treasure is then quickly deposited and the operative may peek from the rocky outcropping or from behind the tree to survey for spies. The territory secure, she can then slink away, being afforded two furtive glances; one, quickly over the shoulder at ten paces away, and the other, stopped, fully-turned around, for longer, from a hundred paces up the path.</p>
<p>Looking back, the tree stands out from the other trees, the sun falls on the rock in which the treasure is hidden; we behold a portrait of a complicit landscape and the conspirator agent intimately familiar with a corner of it. We see that the hiding place is as wonderful as the treasure it contains; from childhood, we feel with certainty the preciousness of the unseen fold in the surface of the world that is only ours, a stone or bark lockbox, harbor of our secret treasures. And with every return to that hidden space, the unseen hollow is approached with the same glee which builds and builds until we are scrambling over the boulders and still pools and bramble thickets, until the hollow is there before us, until it is revealed, the treasures rediscovered, and the scraped elbows and torn trouser legs forgotten.</p>
