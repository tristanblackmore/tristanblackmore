  <p>The story of how the project Tantamount to a mythology came to be named is the way to understand its intention and methodology. I came across the phrase in a dark, old bookstore, in an ancient book that was practically falling apart in my hands. I had flipped to a random page, and there was the phrase "tantamount to a mythology" on the top line. I liked the phrase and remembered to write it down later, but I never thought to buy the book, and I never recorded its title. Weeks later, incredibly, the bookstore burned down, and despite many attempts, I have never been able to find the book again.</p>
