  <p>tantamount to a mythology
  <p>The story of how the project tantamount to a mythology came to be named is the best way to understand its intention and methodology. Years ago, I came across the phrase by accident in a dark, old bookstore, in an ancient book that was practically falling apart in my hands. I had flipped to a random page, and there was the phrase, in faded ink, "tantamount to a mythology" written on the top line. Something about it resonated, I liked how it sounded, and I remembered to write it down later, but I never thought to buy the book, and I never recorded its title. Weeks later, incredibly, the bookstore burned down, and despite many attempts, I have never been able to find the book again.</p>
